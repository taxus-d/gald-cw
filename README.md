The source code of the visualiastions part of the thesis is being develeped at sourcehut repo (see https://git.sr.ht/~taxuswc/gd-viztools/tree)
and will be uploaded here upon cleanup (yaml config is still an unholy mess). 

Full text of the thesis (in Russian) will be made available at `thesis` folder upon publication of the corresponding article.
